I am a PhD student in Economics at the University. I study
  - How the expansion of public pre-K affects the child care market
  - How Lyft's acquisition of bikeshare service Motivate affects the competition in the ride share market (with Suleyman Gozen)
  - How effective state grants distributed to child care providers during the Covid-19 pandemic were to keep child care providers open (with Jonathan Borowsky, Elizabeth Davis and Aaron Sojourner)

I am working as an RA for Elizabeth Davis and Aaron Sojourner of University of Minnesota.
